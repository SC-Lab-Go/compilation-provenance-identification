Step 1: Run train_feature.sh,  there are two settings 1. sw_level, 2. bin_level
        -> sw_level to test the code on software level
        -> bin_level to test and train model on binary level
Step 2: Run evaluation_sw_based.sh for software level evaluation. or evaluation_bin_based.sh to get the accuracy on binary level.
